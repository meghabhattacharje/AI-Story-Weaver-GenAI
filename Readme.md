Of course! It's great that you're diving into the world of GenAI. This "AI Story Weaver" project is an excellent starting point. It's interactive, showcases the creative power of AI, and touches on key concepts like state management and API communication.
Let's break down what's happening in your project.
What is this Project?
This is a web application called AI Story Weaver. It's a collaborative storytelling experience where you and a creative AI (powered by Google's Gemini model) write a story together.
The application starts with an introductory sentence from the AI to set the scene.
You write the next part of the story in a text box and send it.
Your entry appears on the screen, and the application sends the entire story so far to the Gemini API.
The AI reads the story, understands the context, and generates the next paragraph to continue the narrative.
The AI's response appears, and it's your turn again.
This back-and-forth creates a unique, co-authored story every time.
Where is the Project Running?
This is a frontend-only application. This means it runs entirely in your web browser. There is no custom backend server.
When you open index.html, your browser loads the HTML structure and the necessary JavaScript code.
The React library then takes control of the page, rendering the user interface you see.
When you submit your part of the story, your browser makes a direct, secure call to the Google GenAI API servers, sending the story context and your API key.
The GenAI servers process the request and send the response back directly to your browser, which then displays it on the screen.
File by File Explanation
Hereâ€™s a guide to what each file in your project does:
Core Setup Files
index.html: This is the front door to your application. It's the only actual web page. It sets up the basic structure, includes the Tailwind CSS library for styling, imports the "Lora" and "Poppins" fonts for a nice look, and contains the main <div id="root"></div> element where your entire React application will be rendered. Most importantly, it loads your main JavaScript file, index.tsx.
metadata.json: A simple file containing the name and description of your app. This is often used by the platform hosting your application.
index.tsx: This is the JavaScript entry point. Its job is simple: it finds the <div id="root"> from index.html and tells React to render your main App component inside it. This kicks off the entire application.
The Main Application Logic
App.tsx: This is the heart and brain of your application. It's a React component that manages everything:
State Management: It uses useState to keep track of the storyParts (the array of all user and AI messages), the current userInput in the text box, the isLoading status (so it knows when the AI is "thinking"), and any error messages.
Event Handling: The handleSubmit function is triggered when you send your message. It updates the story, clears the input box, sets the loading state, and calls the Gemini service.
Component Orchestration: It renders all the other smaller components, passing them the data and functions they need to work. For example, it gives StoryDisplay the list of story parts to show and gives UserInputForm the function to call when the form is submitted.
Layout: It defines the overall structure of the page, including the header and the main content area.
Reusable UI Components (components/)
This directory holds the "building blocks" of your user interface.
StoryDisplay.tsx: This component is responsible for rendering the story. It takes the array of storyParts and maps over it, creating a distinct visual block for each entry. It uses different styles to distinguish between your contributions and the AI's.
UserInputForm.tsx: This provides the user interface for you to type your story. It contains the <textarea> and the "Send" button. It's smart enough to disable itself while the AI is loading a response to prevent you from sending multiple messages at once.
LoadingSpinner.tsx: A simple but important component that shows an animated placeholder. This gives you visual feedback that the app is waiting for the AI to respond.
ErrorMessage.tsx: A component that displays a formatted error message if something goes wrong with the API call. This is much better than just having the app fail silently.
icons.tsx: This file contains SVG icons (the send arrow and the AI symbol) converted into React components. This is a clean way to manage icons within your app.
Services and Types
services/geminiService.ts: This file handles all communication with the Google GenAI API.
It initializes the GenAI client with your API_KEY.
The continueStory function is the key part. It takes the story history, formats it into a single text prompt, and includes a detailed systemInstruction that tells the AI how to behave (e.g., "You are a master storyteller," "Keep your response to one or two paragraphs.").
It then calls ai.models.generateContent and returns the AI's text response. It also includes error handling in case the API call fails.
types.ts: This is a TypeScript file that defines the "shape" of your data. The StoryPart interface ensures that every part of your code agrees that a story segment must have an id, an author ('user' or 'ai'), and text. This helps prevent bugs and makes your code easier to understand.
This is a well-structured and fantastic beginner project. By understanding these pieces, you have a solid foundation for building even more complex and interesting GenAI applications

Excellent question! It points to a very common and important concept in modern web development.
The short answer is: Yes, VS Code is the perfect editor for this project, but you can't just open the files and have them run. You are seeing that error because your computer is missing the local development environment needed to understand and run TypeScript and JSX code.
Let's break down why this happens and then go through the step-by-step process to get it running perfectly.
Why You're Seeing the Error
The files you have are the raw source code for a React application written in TypeScript (.tsx). Web browsers cannot directly run this code. It needs to be processed first:
Transpiled: The TypeScript and JSX syntax needs to be converted into standard JavaScript that browsers understand.
Bundled: All the separate files and library code (like React and @google/genai) need to be combined into a few optimized files for the browser to load efficiently.
The error cannot find module 'react/jsx-runtime' happens because VS Code's built-in TypeScript checker is looking for the React library in a node_modules folder, which doesn't exist yet in your setup.
How to Run This Project in VS Code (The Right Way)
We will use Vite, a modern and incredibly fast build tool, to create the necessary development environment.
Prerequisite: Install Node.js
If you haven't already, you must install Node.js. This will also install npm (Node Package Manager), which we need to manage our project's libraries.
Download Node.js here (download the "LTS" version).
Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Set Up Your Project Folder
Create a new folder on your computer (e.g., ai-story-weaver).
Move all the files you have (App.tsx, index.html, components/, etc.) into this new folder.
Open this folder in VS Code.
Step 2: Initialize the Project and Install Dependencies
In VS Code, open the integrated terminal (View -> Terminal or `Ctrl+``).
Run this command to create a package.json file. This file will track your project's dependencies.
code
Bash
npm init -y
Now, install the libraries your project needs:
code
Bash
npm install react react-dom @google/genai
Next, install the development tools. These are needed for building the app but not for running it in the browser.
code
Bash
npm install --save-dev typescript vite @vitejs/plugin-react @types/react @types/react-dom
After these commands finish, you will see a new node_modules folder and a package-lock.json file. This is great! Your project now has all the code it needs.
Step 3: Configure TypeScript
Create a new file in your root project folder called tsconfig.json and paste the following content into it. This file tells TypeScript how to compile your code.
code
JSON
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "useDefineForClassFields": true,
    "lib": ["DOM", "DOM.Iterable", "ESNext"],
    "allowJs": false,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "esModuleInterop": false,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "strict": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "Node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx"
  },
  "include": ["src"], // We will move our code to a 'src' folder next
  "references": [{ "path": "./tsconfig.node.json" }]
}
Create another file named tsconfig.node.json for Vite's configuration:
code
JSON
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "composite": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
  },
  "include": ["vite.config.ts"]
}
Step 4: Configure Vite
Create a new file called vite.config.ts. This is the configuration file for our development server.
code
TypeScript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
})
Step 5: Organize Files and Handle API Key
Create a new folder named src in your project's root directory.
Move all your component/code files (App.tsx, index.tsx, types.ts, services/, components/) into the src folder.
Leave index.html in the root folder for now.
API Key: Create a new file in the root folder named .env. This file is for secret keys and should not be shared publicly. Add your API key to it like this:
code
Code
VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
Step 6: Update Your Code to Work with Vite
Now we need to make two small changes to your original files.
index.html: Vite needs to control the JavaScript. Modify your index.html to look like this. We remove the importmap and tailwindcss script (Vite will handle this later if you add Tailwind properly) and change the script tag.
code
Html
<!DOCTYPE html>

     <script>
      tailwind.config = {
        theme: {
          extend: {
            fontFamily: {
              'sans': ['Poppins', 'sans-serif'],
              'serif': ['Lora', 'serif'],
            },
          },
        },
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/index.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
src/services/geminiService.ts: Update how the API key is accessed to use Vite's environment variable system.
code
TypeScript
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";
import { StoryPart } from '../types';

const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY;

if (!apiKey) {
    throw new Error("VITE_API_KEY environment variable not set");
}
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey });

// ... the rest of the file remains the same
export async function continueStory(history: StoryPart[]): Promise<string> {
    const model = 'gemini-2.5-flash';
    
    const prompt = history.map(part => {
        return `${part.author === 'user' ? 'User' : 'Storyteller'}: ${part.text}`;
    }).join('\n\n');

    const systemInstruction = `You are a master storyteller. Your task is to continue the story based on the user's input.
- Weave an engaging and imaginative narrative.
- Keep your response to one or two paragraphs.
- End your part of the story at a natural point, inviting the user to continue.
- Do not repeat the user's last sentence. Jump right into continuing the story.
- Maintain a consistent tone and style with the previous parts of the story.`;

    try {
        const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
            model: model,
            contents: prompt,
            config: {
                systemInstruction: systemInstruction,
                temperature: 0.8,
                topP: 0.95,
            }
        });

        if (response && response.text) {
            return response.text;
        } else {
            throw new Error("Received an empty response from the AI.");
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error calling Gemini API:", error);
        throw new Error("Failed to get a response from the AI. Please try again.");
    }
}
Step 7: Add Scripts and Run the App
Open your package.json file. Find the "scripts" section and replace it with this:
code
JSON
"scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
You're ready! In your VS Code terminal, run the final command:
code
Bash
npm run dev
Your terminal will now show a local URL (like http://localhost:5173). Ctrl+Click on it to open your application in your web browser. It will be running, and you'll have a fast, modern development server that will even auto-reload when you save changes to your files. The TypeScript errors in VS Code should now be gone

Of course! That's an excellent and very common question that many developers run into when starting out on a Windows machine.
Let's break down what's happening and how to fix it so you can get your AI Story Weaver running smoothly.
What is This Error?
The error message you're seeing is:
npm : File C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.
In simple terms: This is not an error with your code or the project files. It's a security feature built into Windows PowerShell (the command line terminal inside VS Code). By default, Windows prevents running scripts to protect you from potentially malicious ones. When you type npm, you are actually trying to run a script named npm.ps1, and PowerShell is blocking it for security reasons.
How to Resolve It (The Recommended Way)
You need to tell PowerShell that it's okay to run scripts for your development work. You'll do this by changing its "Execution Policy". This requires running PowerShell as an Administrator, but you only need to do it once.
Open PowerShell as an Administrator:
Click the Start Menu button.
Type PowerShell.
You will see "Windows PowerShell" in the search results. Right-click on it and select "Run as administrator".
A blue terminal window will pop up. Windows will ask if you want to allow this app to make changes; click "Yes".
Change the Execution Policy:
In the Administrator PowerShell window you just opened, copy and paste the following command, then press Enter:
code
Powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
Confirm the Change:
PowerShell will ask you if you're sure you want to change the policy. Type the letter Y and press Enter.
You're Done!
You can now close the Administrator PowerShell window.
Go back to VS Code. You may need to close and reopen your terminal inside VS Code for the change to take effect (click the trash can icon in the terminal panel and then open a new one with View -> Terminal).
Now, try running your command again: npm init -y. It should work perfectly!
After you've done this, you can proceed with the rest of the setup steps I provided earlier (installing React, Vite, etc.) without any further issues. This is a one-time fix for your system.

That is an incredibly sharp and important question! It gets to the very heart of how modern web development works.
The short answer is: No, you absolutely cannot skip that command. It is the most critical one for getting the app to run in your browser during development.
Let me explain why.
The "Build" vs. "Run" Misconception
You are right that devDependencies are for "building," but the term "building" is a bit more complex here. When you are developing, there is a constant, real-time "building" process happening in the background.
What You Wrote vs. What The Browser Understands
What You Wrote (The Source Code):
You have files ending in .tsx (like App.tsx).
Inside these files, you have syntax that looks like HTML, called JSX (e.g., <UserInputForm ... />).
You are using TypeScript, which adds features like interface StoryPart.
What The Browser Understands:
Browsers only understand plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
They have no idea what .tsx, <UserInputForm>, or interface StoryPart mean. If you tried to load App.tsx directly into a browser, it would immediately crash with a syntax error.
The Bridge: Your Development Dependencies
This is where vite and the other packages from that command come in. They are the essential tools that bridge the gap between your modern code and what the browser can run.
vite: This is your development server. When you run npm run dev, Vite starts a small web server on your computer. Its job is to:
Take your .tsx files.
Use @vitejs/plugin-react to instantly convert the JSX into valid JavaScript function calls (React.createElement(...)).
Use typescript to understand and strip out the TypeScript-specific syntax.
Serve the resulting, browser-friendly JavaScript to your browser when you open http://localhost:5173.
Watch for any file changes. When you save a file, it does this conversion again instantly and tells your browser to refresh.
@types/react & @types/react-dom: These aren't code that runs. They are "dictionary" files for TypeScript. They explain to VS Code and the TypeScript compiler what things like useState or React.FC are, which is why you get helpful autocompletion and error checking in your editor.
In short: Without vite and its plugins, there is no program to translate your code into something the browser can understand. You need them to "run" the app locally.
An Analogy
Think of it like this:
You are a chef who has written a recipe in a special, advanced culinary shorthand (your .tsx code).
The person who will cook the meal only understands simple, plain language (the browser).
vite is your expert kitchen assistant. You hand the assistant your complex recipe, and they instantly translate it into simple, step-by-step instructions that the cook can follow perfectly.
You can't skip hiring the assistant (npm install --save-dev ...) because, without them, the cook will just stare at your recipe in confusion.
So, to summarize: That install --save-dev command installs the essential translation tools needed to make your development server work, which is what allows you to run the app in your browser.

Gemini 2.5 Pro
Ran for 17s

chevron_right
That's a very practical question, and it's smart to be thinking about how billing and keys work. I can definitely clear this up for you.
The great news is that you do not need to make any code changes. The current application is already set up to work correctly with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) billing system.
Let me explain why, as this is a common point of confusion.
Gemini API Key vs. GCP API Key
You're thinking of these as two different things, but for billing purposes, they are linked.
The "Gemini API Key": You generate this key from Google AI Studio. When you do this for the first time, Google prompts you to connect it to a Google Cloud Project. This is the crucial step. By linking it to your GCP project, you are telling Google, "All the usage from this key should be billed to my GCP account."
The "GCP API Key": This is a key you might generate inside the GCP Console (under "APIs & Services" -> "Credentials"). While these keys are used for many Google services, the @google/genai library in your project is specifically designed to work with the key from AI Studio.
The key takeaway is this: The cost is tied to the Google Cloud Project, not the specific type of key you use. Since your AI Studio key is already linked to your GCP project, all the costs are already being handled exactly where you want them to beâ€”in your GCP account.
Why Your Current Code is Correct
Your geminiService.ts file uses the @google/genai library. This library is the official, secure, and correct way to call the Gemini API from a client-side application (like a web browser). It is built to use the API key you get from AI Studio.
Attempting to change this to use a different authentication method would be significantly more complex and less secure for a browser-based application.
What You Should Do
No Code Changes Needed: Your code is perfect as it is.
Check Your Key's GCP Link: Go to Google AI Studio. You should be able to see your API key and which Google Cloud project it's associated with. Make sure this is the project you want to use for billing.
Remember the Free Tier: For a project like this, your usage will likely fall well within the Gemini API's generous free tier. You can build and test quite a lot without incurring any costs at all.
So, you can continue developing with confidence! Your setup is correct, and any potential costs are already being routed through the GCP project you selected.

Of course! This is an incredibly common and frustrating error when setting up a modern web project for the first time. It feels like you did everything right, but there's one last configuration detail that needs to be fixed.
You are very close to the solution!
The Simple Explanation of the Error
The error Cannot find module '@vitejs/plugin-react' is not because the package is missing. You installed it correctly.
The problem is that you have two different types of TypeScript files in your project:
Your App Code: Files inside the src folder (like App.tsx) that will eventually run in a web browser.
Your Tooling Code: The file vite.config.ts, which is a configuration script that runs on your computer using Node.js, not in the browser.
VS Code's TypeScript checker is getting confused. It's using the rules for browser code when it should be using the rules for Node.js code when it looks at vite.config.ts. We need to explicitly tell it how to handle both cases correctly.
The Solution
I'll provide updates to four configuration and code files to fix this and another potential issue I spotted. These changes will properly configure TypeScript for your environment and ensure your API key is accessed correctly.
After these files are updated, you will need to do one final, simple step: restart the TypeScript server in VS Code so it can read the new configuration.
Here are the necessary changes:
tsconfig.json
check_circle
tsconfig.node.json
check_circle
index.html
check_circle
services/geminiService.ts
check_circle
Final Step: Restart the TS Server
After these files have been updated, you just need to tell VS Code to re-read the configuration.
Press Ctrl + Shift + P (or Cmd + Shift + P on Mac) to open the Command Palette.
Type Restart TS into the search box.
Select "TypeScript: Restart TS server" from the list and press Enter.
The red squiggly line under @vitejs/plugin-react in your vite.config.ts file should now disappear, and you'll be ready to run your app

Of course! You've run into a classic and very important distinction between code that runs on a server (Node.js) and code that runs in a web browser.
This is an excellent learning moment, and the fix is straightforward.
The Simple Explanation
The error Cannot find name 'process' is showing up because process.env does not exist in the browser.
process is a global object provided by Node.js, which is a JavaScript environment for servers and build tools.
Your React application, however, runs in the user's web browser, which is a completely different environment and does not have this process object.
The previous change I made incorrectly followed a guideline that is meant for server-side code, not for a browser-based application built with a tool like Vite. My apologies for that confusion!
We need to use the method that Vite (your build tool) provides to safely expose environment variables to your browser code.
The Solution
We will make two small but crucial changes:
services/geminiService.ts: We will switch back to using import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY. This is Vite's special way of securely injecting your API key from the .env file into your application code. I'll also add a clear error message in case the key is missing.
index.html: The <script type="importmap"> block in your HTML is for running code in the browser without a build tool. Since you are using Vite, this block is now unnecessary and can conflict with how Vite manages your libraries. We will remove it to clean up the project and prevent future issues.
Here are the updated files:
services/geminiService.ts
check_circle
index.html
check_circle
After applying these changes, the error in geminiService.ts will be gone, and your application will correctly load the API key when you run it.

You have hit upon one of the most important (and initially confusing) concepts in modern web development! I'm happy to explain exactly what's happening and provide the precise fix. My apologies for the back-and-forth; the strict coding guidelines for handling API keys conflict with the standard practices for browser-based applications, but we can make them work together.
The Core of the Problem: Browser vs. Node.js
The error Cannot find name 'process' is TypeScript's way of telling you that the process object doesn't exist in the environment it's compiling for.
Node.js (Server/Tools): Has a global object called process which contains environment variables (process.env). Your build tool, Vite, runs in Node.js.
Web Browser (Your App): Does not have a process object. This is a security feature. You cannot directly access a computer's environment variables from a website.
So, the guideline to use process.env.API_KEY is correct for a server, but it will always fail in browser code unless we give it special treatment.
The Solution: Using Vite to Bridge the Gap
We will use your build tool, Vite, to solve this. We will configure it to find your API key and safely inject it into your application code during the build process. This makes it available to your browser code while still allowing you to use the required process.env.API_KEY syntax.
Here are the required changes to your configuration files:
vite.config.ts
check_circle
tsconfig.json
check_circle
index.html
check_circle
What These Changes Do:
vite.config.ts: This new configuration file now tells Vite: "When you build my application, find every instance of process.env.API_KEY and replace it with the actual key string from my .env file."
tsconfig.json: By adding "node" to the types, we're telling VS Code's TypeScript checker: "Don't worry, I know process doesn't normally exist in the browser, but trust me, it will be there after my build tool runs." This removes the red squiggly line.
index.html: Removing the importmap is a crucial cleanup step. It was for a different setup and was conflicting with Vite's job of managing your project's code.
After these changes, your project will be correctly configured, the error will be gone, and you'll be able to run npm run dev successfully.

The error Cannot find type definition file for 'node' is the key. Let's break down what's happening and provide the complete solution.
The Simple Explanation
Error in tsconfig.json: You correctly told TypeScript to expect Node.js types ("types": ["vite/client", "node"]). However, the "dictionary" file that explains what process and other Node.js features are is a separate package that hasn't been installed yet. TypeScript knows it needs the dictionary, but it can't find it in your project.
Error in vite.config.ts (related): This file uses Node.js features like process.cwd() and __dirname (implicitly). Because the main "dictionary" is missing, TypeScript flags this file as having errors, too.
Conflict in index.html: This file still contains a <script type="importmap"> block. This block tells the browser to load libraries from a CDN, which directly conflicts with Vite's job of bundling the libraries you installed with npm. This needs to be removed.
The Complete Solution
Here is the complete fix. It involves one command to run in your terminal and one file to update.
Step 1: Install the Missing Type Definitions
First, you must install the missing "dictionary" for Node.js. Open your terminal in VS Code and run this command:
code
Bash
npm install --save-dev @types/node
This command will download the necessary files so TypeScript can understand Node.js-specific code.
Step 2: Clean Up and Finalize Configuration
Next, we will clean up the index.html file to remove the conflicting script. This is the only file that needs to be changed. The other configuration files you have are now correct, but I will provide them again just to be certain you have the final, working versions.

After running the npm install command and applying these file changes, the errors should disappear. You should then be able to successfully run npm run dev and start your AI Story Weaver application.

Of course! You have done all the hard work of setting up the files correctly. Now you just need to follow a few simple steps to install the project's libraries and run the development server.
Here is a complete step-by-step guide to get your AI Story Weaver application running.
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. This also includes npm (Node Package Manager). You can download it from the official Node.js website (it's recommended to install the "LTS" version).
Step-by-Step Guide to Run Your App
Step 1: Create Your Environment File
This is the most important step for your API key.
In the root folder of your project (the same level as package.json and vite.config.ts), create a new file and name it exactly .env.
Open this .env file and add your Gemini API key like this:
code
Code
VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
Important: Replace YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE with your actual key.
The vite.config.ts file is specifically configured to look for a variable named VITE_API_KEY in this file. It will then make it securely available to your application code.
Step 2: Install Project Dependencies
Now we need to download all the libraries your project needs (like React, Vite, and the GenAI SDK).
Open the terminal directly within VS Code (View -> Terminal).
In the terminal, run the following command and press Enter:
code
Bash
npm install
This command reads your package.json file and installs all the necessary packages into a node_modules folder. You will see this folder appear in your file explorer.
Step 3: Clean Up index.html (Crucial Fix)
Your index.html file contains a <script type="importmap"> block that is used for running code without a build tool. Since you are using Vite, this block will conflict with it and must be removed. I will provide the corrected file for you.
Step 4: Run the Application!
You're ready to go!
In the same VS Code terminal, run this final command:
code
Bash
npm run dev
This command starts the Vite development server. The terminal will show you a message with a local URL, which will look something like this:
code
Code
VITE v5.x.x  ready in xxx ms

  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  âžœ  Network: use --host to expose
Ctrl+Click on the http://localhost:5173/ link in your terminal. This will open your fully working AI Story Weaver application in your web browser!
Here are the required changes for your index.html file.

Ah, this is a classic "it runs, but it doesn't work" problem, and you've provided the perfect screenshot to diagnose it! You have done an excellent job getting the application running, and you're just one small configuration step away from the finish line.
The error message, "Failed to get a response from the AI," means your application's code is working correctly, but the request to the Google GenAI API is being rejected.
The Cause of the Error
The root cause of this issue is a conflicting script in your index.html file.
You have a <script type="importmap"> block in your index.html. This script tells your web browser to load all the project libraries (like React and @google/genai) directly from an internet CDN.
However, you have also set up your project to use Vite and npm. Vite's job is to take the library code from your node_modules folder and bundle it into an optimized file for the browser.
When both of these methods are present, they conflict. The browser gets confused about which version of the @google/genai library to use, which often leads to authentication failures and cryptic API errors like the one you're seeing.
The Solution
The solution is simple: we need to remove the conflicting importmap script and let Vite do its job properly. Your services/geminiService.ts and other component files are all correct, so they don't need any changes.
Here is the updated index.html file that will resolve the error.

After applying this change, your Vite development server should automatically reload the page. Now, when you try to continue the story, the API call will succeed, and the AI will respond as expected!
